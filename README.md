Hi this is a place where I put my shell scripts. Here's what they do:

#### dir\_diff.sh
usage: `./dir_diff.sh <dir1> <dir2> <output dir>`

Diffs files in the two folders, matching on filename. Outputs diff files and a report of nonexistant files (called `nonexistant_report_<timestamp>.txt`) to `<output dir>`.
